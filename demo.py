	You can check that they point to the same function in memory by doing
	Assertions are great for defensive programming, if you want to make sure
	in one line that something is true, instead of assuming that it is
		http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assertion_(computing)

	When assertions fail, they raise an AssertionException
	Be careful about depending on assertions â€“ in python they can be removed
	by running the interpreter with the -oo flags (optimize). You should only
	use them for sanity checks, like making sure that something is an object.

	assert f is function

	return f(thing)

	# Remember that names in python are all tags on objects
	# When we say 'return result', we're returning the function that we just defined.

Here's a real-world example from some code I wrote in Compilers (CS331)

<import regex at the top of the program>

tok_spec = [
            ('T_NUM',           r'\d+'),                       #Numbers
            ('T_STRING',        r'"[^"]*"'),                   #Strings
            ('IGNORE',          r'\s|\n'),                     #Ignore spaces and newlines
        ]

tok_regex = '|'.join('(?P<{0}>{1})'.format(*pair) for pair in tok_spec) #Named regex pairs for each item in tok_spec
get_tok = re.compile(tok_regex).match #Regex match function

#Later on you can just call get_tok on a string, and it will return a regex match object
match_object = get_tok(line)

	if DEBUG:
		print("Debugged")

	print(caller(square, 5))
	
	square_of_plus_one = compose(square, plus_one)
	print(square_of_plus_one(1))

	plus_one_of_square = compose(plus_one, square)

__name__ is a special variable which is set by the python interpreter. 
It will be '__main__' if your program is being run from the command line,
	but if your program is being imported by some other script, it will be
