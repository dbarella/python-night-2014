	When assertions fail, they raise an AssertionException
	Be careful about depending on assertions â€“ in python they can be removed

Here's a real-world example from some code I wrote in Compilers (CS331)

<import regex at the top of the program>

tok_spec = [
            ('T_NUM',           r'\d+'),                       #Numbers
            ('T_STRING',        r'"[^"]*"'),                   #Strings
            ('IGNORE',          r'\s|\n'),                     #Ignore spaces and newlines
        ]

tok_regex = '|'.join('(?P<{0}>{1})'.format(*pair) for pair in tok_spec) #Named regex pairs for each item in tok_spec
get_tok = re.compile(tok_regex).match #Regex match function

#Later on you can just call get_tok on a string, and it will return a regex match object
match_object = get_tok(line)

#--- Decorators ---

# Like the `compose` function above, sometimes we want to modify the
# functionality of one function in some generic way *without* changing
# the function itself. Python provides a feature to generalize
# function composition, called function decorators.

def to_paragraph(string):
        '''
        Returns the given string, wrapped in HTML paragraph tags.
        '''
        return '<p>' + string + '</p>'

# The above function will allow us to turn any string into an HTML
# paragraph (without proper HTML escaping, but that's a whole
# different topic).

def a_cool_string(string):
        'Makes strings really cool.'
        return string + '. Whoaaaaa cool.'

# Now, what if we want to wrap the `string` argument of
# `a_cool_string` in paragraph tags? We could either call
# `to_paragraph` inside the function, OR we could use a decorator.

def to_paragraph_decorator(function):
        '''
        Decorators are just regular functions. They are given a
        function as an argument (so they're higher-order functions),
        and they return one as a result.

        The power of decorators is that when we apply them, as we'll
        see later, they take the function they're applied to as an
        argument, and get a chance to replace it with something
        else. Usually that something else is a new function which
        wraps the old one.

        This all gets done when the function is being defined, so the
        code in this function will be run once.
        '''
        print('wrapping function...')
        def wrapper(*args):
                print("I'm the wrapper function!")
                return function(to_paragraph(args[0]))
        print('done wrapping...')
        return wrapper

# We apply decorators to functions by using the @-syntax.

@to_paragraph_decorator
def decorated_cool_string(string):
        return string + '. Whoaaaaa cool.'

# Decorators are used in a variety of different ways. For example,
# some Python web frameworks use decorators in order to route URLs to
# the appropriate handler function. You can also easily implement
# caching/memoization with a decorator, or enforce type-correctness of
# function arguments and results.

def main():
	if DEBUG:
		print("Debugged")

	square_of_plus_one = compose(square, plus_one)
	print(square_of_plus_one(1))

	plus_one_of_square = compose(plus_one, square)
